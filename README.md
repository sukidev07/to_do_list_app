### Core concepts to learn CRUD
----------------------------------
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

### task:
-----------------------------------
main.py
Created a while true loop with selection options
(1-4)
1. add
2. list
3. delete
4. exit

Worked on making a list tasks []
Use of the function append() to add input values to the list
Use of the function pop() to get an index value and perform multi actions
1. get the string value so we can store and repeat the value name confirming we deleted the list item
2. remove the actual indexed item
3. added a -1 to the operation since we provide number range starting at 1 to x but idexing starts at 0
   if you select 1 you need to delete index 0 thus the extra added mathing
